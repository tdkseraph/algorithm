# Sort an array in one swap whose two elements are swapped by mistake
# Given an array where all its elements are sorted except two elements which
# were swapped, sort the array in linear time. Assume there are no duplicates in the array.
# Input:  A[] = [3, 8, 6, 7, 5, 9] OR [3, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7] OR [3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9]
# Output: A[] = [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
